<center>Easy GIT -- <i>git for mere mortals</i></center>

<p>
Easy GIT is a wrapper for <a href="http://git.or.cz/">git</a>, designed to
make git easy to use.  It is mostly meant as a brainstorming session about
what git could be, hopefully as a means to spark discussion about
simplifying its UI.  But it may also well serve as "training wheels for
git" in the meantime.  If nothing else, I think it is a useful exercise for
me.
</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>
My purpose is to demonstrate that a version of git could be written that
achieves the following goals:
<ul>
  <li> <i>Easy</i>: I want it to be easy to use...and as easy for people to
       transition to from other VCSes, as switching from cvs to svn
       was. (Not seamless, but not difficult)</li>
  <li> <i>Capable</i>: I want it to be something that git lovers would still
       love to use.  Many suggestions to "fix" git's UI often curtail its
       power (<i>git add -p</i> is one of my favorite features and you
       better not take it away or make using it more difficult).</li>
  <li> <i>Friendly</i>: I want it to "feel friendly" to new users and
       converts from other systems, as well as to long time users.  A lot
       of things in git are beautiful from an architectural point of view
       once you understand all the internals, but much of git's UI
       just <i>feels</i> sharp and uninviting.  Perhaps I am just still
       missing some details of its internals or capabilities, but I don't
       believe that the sharpness is actually necessary.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Switching</h3>

<p>
I would really like to have a tool that
<ul>
  <li> SVN, bzr, or hg users can pick up and use almost immediately.</li>
  <li> git users can pick up and use almost immediately.</li>
</ul>
Some may scoff, but I think it is not farfetched.  I think the biggest
surprise in eg so far for git users is:
<pre>
    git diff      <=> eg diff --unstaged
    git diff HEAD <=> eg diff
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Try it out</h3>

<p>
First, you need to install <a href="http://git.or.cz/">git</a> (eg is just
a wrapper; it usually just passes its arguments to git though sometimes it
massages things...particularly the help pages).  Then run
<blockquote>
    <b>git clone http://www.gnome.org/~newren/eg/eg.git eg</b>
</blockquote>
Stick the eg directory in your path and you're ready to go.  If you aren't
one of those shoot first and ask questions later types, just fire off an
'eg help'.

<h3>Work in progress</h3>

<p>
Unfortunately, eg is not complete; it's just a preliminary version of a
work in progress.  For example, you may find it referring to help pages
that don't yet exist.  Sorry about that.  However, it is good enough for
daily use already...at least for me.
