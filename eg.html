<center>Easy GIT -- <i>git for mere mortals</i></center>

<p>
<i>Warning: Easy GIT is incomplete and slightly buggy to boot.</i>
</p>

<h3>What is Easy GIT (eg)?</h3>
<p>
In short, Easy GIT is a wrapper for <a href="http://git.or.cz/">git</a>,
designed to make git easy to use.  (If you are not familiar with what git
is, this page will make no sense to you.)  In more detail:
<ul>
  <li>eg is a brainstorming session about simplifying the user interface of
      git, in the form of a usable demonstration</li>
  <li>eg is predominantly an exercise in writing documentation; I'd
      guess that 95% of the lines of the program are inline text for
      its replacement help system.</li>
  <li>eg is essentially command-line backwards compatible to git;
      those familiar with git can start using eg by simply replacing
      "git" with "eg" in their commands (the biggest surprise is with
      diff, see below).</li>
  <li>eg is example driven; the documentation focuses heavily on
      examples</li>
  <li>eg is incomplete and probably buggy.  Sorry, I'm working on
      it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>
My purpose is to demonstrate that a version of git could be written that
achieves the following goals:
<ul>
  <li> <i>Easy</i>: I want it to be easy to use...and as easy for people to
       transition to from other VCSes, as switching from cvs to svn
       was. (Not seamless, but not difficult)</li>
  <li> <i>Capable</i>: I want it to be something that git lovers would still
       love to use.  Many suggestions to "fix" git's UI often curtail its
       power (<i>git add -p</i> is one of my favorite features and you
       better not take it away or make using it more difficult).</li>
  <li> <i>Friendly</i>: I want it to "feel friendly" to new users and
       converts from other systems, as well as to long time users.  A lot
       of things in git are beautiful from an architectural point of view
       once you understand all the internals, but much of git's UI
       just <i>feels</i> sharp and uninviting.  Perhaps I am just still
       missing some details of its internals or capabilities, but I don't
       believe that the sharpness is actually necessary.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Facilitating transition</h3>

<p>
I would really like to have a tool that
<ul>
  <li> SVN, bzr, or hg users can pick up and use almost immediately.</li>
  <li> git users can pick up and use almost immediately.</li>
</ul>
Some may scoff, but I think it is not farfetched.

<h3>Benefits for current GIT users</h3>

<p>
If you're a current GIT user and fan, there are all kinds of new
capabilities waiting for you.  Such as....um...well...nothing.  Sorry, the
goal isn't to introduce new powerful capabilities; it's to make the power
of git accessible to a wider audience.  However, 'eg info' may help you
fill out the GIT user survey a little faster.
</p>

<p>
In terms of gotchas for GIT users, I don't think there are any.  None of
the changes in eg result in different data being recorded (or unrecorded);
the biggest surprise for existing git users is the following change:
<pre>
    git diff      <=> eg diff --unstaged
    git diff HEAD <=> eg diff
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Try it!</h3>

<p>
First, you need to install <a href="http://git.or.cz/">git</a> (eg is just
a wrapper, which simply passes its arguments on to git except in specific
important cases).  Then run
<blockquote>
    <b>git clone http://www.gnome.org/~newren/eg/eg.git</b>
</blockquote>
Stick the eg directory in your path and you're ready to go.  If you aren't
one of those "shoot first and ask questions later" types, just fire off an
'eg help'.
</p>

<h3>Work in progress</h3>

<p>
Unfortunately, eg is not complete; it's just a preliminary version of a
work in progress.  For example, you may find it referring to help pages
that don't yet exist.  Sorry about that.  However, it is good enough for
daily use already...at least for me.
